# SORTS

started from some basic dependent type in [lean4](https://github.com/leanprover/lean4), I stated this project with the goal to implement the full dependent type system so that it is capable for mathemtical proof. This is probably a decade-long project, hope it would last.  

## EL

```bash
cat example.el | go run cmd/el/main.go
```

or using python syntax
```bash
python cmd/elt/elt.py example.py | go run cmd/el/main.go
```
